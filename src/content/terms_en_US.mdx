By accessing or using the service, you agree to be bound by these terms and conditions. If you do not agree with any part of these terms and conditions, you may not access the service.

## Termination

We may terminate or suspend your access immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any reason, including but not limited to your breach of these terms and conditions.

Upon termination, your right to use the service will immediately cease.

## Limitation of Liability

To the fullest extent permitted by law, in no event shall the Company or its suppliers be liable for any special, incidental, indirect, or consequential damages (including but not limited to loss of profits, data, or other information) arising out of or in connection with your use of or inability to use the service, whether based on warranty, contract, tort (including negligence), or any other legal theory, even if the Company has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, which means that some of the above limitations may not apply to you. In these jurisdictions, each party's liability will be limited to the maximum extent permitted by law.

## “As Is” and “As Available” Disclaimer

The service is provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis, with all defects and imperfections. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the Company, on its own behalf and on behalf of its affiliates and its respective licensors and service providers, expressly disclaims all warranties of any kind, whether express, implied, statutory, or otherwise, including all implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, and non-infringement, and any warranties that may arise from the course of dealing, performance, usage, or trade practice. Without limiting the foregoing, the Company does not provide any warranty or commitment, and makes no representation that the service will meet your requirements, achieve any intended results, be compatible or work with any other software, applications, systems, or services, operate without interruption, meet any performance or reliability standards, or be error-free, or that any errors or defects can or will be corrected.

Without limiting the foregoing, neither the Company nor any provider of the Company makes any warranty or representation of any kind: (i) regarding the operation or availability of the service, or the information, content, and materials or products contained therein; (ii) that the service will be uninterrupted or error-free; (iii) regarding the accuracy, reliability, or timeliness of any information or content provided through the service; or (iv) that the service, its servers, content, or emails sent on behalf of the Company are free of viruses, scripts, trojan horses, worms, malware, time bombs, or other harmful components.

Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain types of warranties or limitations on statutory rights applicable to consumers, so some or all of the above exclusions and limitations may not apply to you. But in such cases, the exclusions and limitations set forth in this section shall apply to the maximum extent permitted by law.

## Governing Law

These terms and your use of the service shall be governed by the laws of the Country, without regard to its conflict of law principles. Your use of the application may also be subject to other local, state, national, or international laws.

If you are a consumer in the European Union, you will benefit from any mandatory provisions of the law of the country in which you reside.

## Compliance with U.S. Law

You represent and warrant that: (i) you are not located in a country that is subject to a U.S. government embargo, or that has been designated by the U.S. government as a “supporting terrorism” country; (ii) you are not listed on any U.S. government list of prohibited or restricted parties.

## Severability and Waiver

### Severability

If any provision of these terms is held to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be modified and interpreted to achieve its intent to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, and the remaining provisions will continue to be in full force and effect.

### Waiver

Except as otherwise provided in these terms, the failure to exercise any right or demand the performance of any obligation will not affect a party's ability to exercise that right or demand the performance of that obligation at any later time, nor shall it constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach.

## Translation Interpretation

If we have provided you with these terms and conditions, they may have been translated. You agree that in the event of a dispute, the original English text shall prevail.

## Modifications to These Terms and Conditions

We reserve the right to modify or replace these terms at any time at our sole discretion.

What constitutes a substantial change will be determined by us at our sole discretion.
